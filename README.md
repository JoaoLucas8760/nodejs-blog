## Key Concepts

### Routes
Routes handle incoming requests and direct them to the appropriate controller based on the URL and request type (e.g., GET, POST).

### Controller
Controllers act as intermediaries between routes and use cases, managing incoming data, executing business logic, and returning responses.

### Use Cases
Use cases represent the business logic layer, encompassing rules, validations, and operations to fulfill functional requirements.

### Repository
The repository manages data access, providing an interface to interact with data sources such as databases or external services.

### Entitty
Entities define the data structure and may include data validation rules.

### Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application, which is useful for managing shared resources.
